# The Servo Parallel Browser Engine Project

Servo is a prototype web browser engine written in the [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) language. It is currently developed on
64-bit macOS, 64-bit Linux, 64-bit Windows, and Android. I, along with 2 other teammates, made open-source contributions for specific features in the Servo engine.

Visit the [Servo GitHub page](https://github.com/servo/servo) for details on getting started, installation and how to contribute.

Features implemented:
* Incorporating the parsing of srcdoc attribute in iframe HTML tag.
* Enabling Servo to submit forms on web pages by fixing the fetching of form elements by ID.
