# Servo Parallel Browser Engine Project

Implementation of missing DOM features in the "Servo" browser engine. This was my project in "CSC 517: Object Oriented Design and Development" course at NC State University.

Servo is a prototype web browser engine written in the [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) language. Visit the [Servo GitHub page](https://github.com/servo/servo) for details on getting started, installation and how to contribute.

## Missing DOM Features Project
* <strong>srcdoc iframe issue</strong> - Incorporating the parsing of srcdoc attribute in iframe HTML tag.
* <strong>named form getter issue</strong> - Enabling Servo to submit forms on web pages by fixing the fetching of form elements by ID.

The project abstract and the steps can be found at this [Project Page](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Missing-DOM-features-project) or [Project Document]().

For more details on the actual implementation and testing of the code in the project, kindly go through this [Wiki page](https://expertiza.csc.ncsu.edu/index.php/CSC/ECE_517_Fall_2019_-_M1952._Missing_DOM_features_project) that we have developed which explains our contributions to the project.
